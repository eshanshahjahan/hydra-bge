=========

This is a quick demo file to try the Razer Hydra in Blender Game Engine.  To see what it looks like, go here:

To run this, you will need:

1. Razer Hydra
2. "Sixense SDK for the Razer Hydra" (available on Steam => Library => Tools)
3. Blender
4. mrwonko's Python bindings for the SDK (available at https://github.com/mrwonko/PySixense/downloads)

Put mrwonko's PySixense.pyd in the same folder as my two files and execute in Blender.

Controls:
* Left wand - camera
* Right wand - gun
* Right trigger - shoot
* Space bar - reset camera position
